## Others

* A [nice 1.5 hr video introduction from the developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTkO8h8RBBI) - This does include some details about the description language.

* [A BGG forum thread](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2529161/ludii-developer-thread-looking-resources-possibly/) - I started this basically to collect these resources.
